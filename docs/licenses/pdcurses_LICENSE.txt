Original PDcurses Public Domain Notice
-------------------------------------
THE PDCURSES SOURCE CODE IS PUBLIC DOMAIN.
However, most of the library uses the public-domain curses APIs,
which have been around for many years and are widely used (and
perhaps misunderstood). The same warnings apply: if you use this
library, you do so AT YOUR OWN RISK. We assume no liability for
your use.
